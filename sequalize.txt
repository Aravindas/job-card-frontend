npm install sequelize pg pg-hstore
npm i -g sequelize-cli  - it will give more feature like create migrations file ...
sequelize init - it will create punch of stuff like config migrations folder

Now we can use sequelize commands
-----------------------------------
sequelize db:create - it will create new database based on our configurations
sequelize db:drop  - it will drop database
sequelize db:migrate  - it will create table or alter table
   note : migrations related things are being stored in sequelizeMeta

sequelize model:generate --name Post --attributes name:string  - it will generate model file with name field and migrations file

sequelize db:migrate:undo - it revert latest one 
sequelize db:migrate:all  - it revert all




Note : sequelize.sync() - method will create table if does not exit
       sequelize.sync({alter:true}) - method will create table even if already exist
       sequelize.authenticate() - method is used to connect database with authenticattion and it will not create or alter any table 


Note : if i dont want to send some column data to user we can do it in model class with toJSON() method
       toJSON(){
          return {...this.get(),id:undefiend}
       }

       2) To write join 
           1) first we need to write belongsTo or hasMany... in associate function in respective model
           2) include is join the tables
